Alvin Jurianto Development Notes: 
1. packages installed has some vulnerabilities, check later by running run npm audit 

2. For now, let's just release the ENV from local to dev server in heroku.... 

3. opening app using custom urls:
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app

4. UI modules to be confirmed
-[] accessing external app from card
does not accept external URL scheme so have to make a https link that redirects there I assume

5. on salesforce oauth access policies
for now on the sandbox I turned on allowing all user access to apps.
When making POC we have to check / create a new access 権限 for line linking app.
